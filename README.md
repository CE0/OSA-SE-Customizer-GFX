# OSA-SE-Customizer-GFX

## Customizer
Customizer comes with OSA and handles randomization for default NPCs that have no persona/profile data. 
These should be packed when finished into OSA-SE but i pulled them out on git so they are easier / clearer to work on. 

# GFX

Names handles the randomization of NPC body tones when they don't have their own profile gfx file.
It generates their body tones, hair color and clothing color based on race and sex.
If the npc has a profile gfx but not everything is filled in the blank slots will be filled by customizer_gfx.

# Style of the GFX

The gfx that can be achieved in this xml should be lore-friendly and serious as if part of Skyrim itself. Forks can be used for crazier variations.

# CustomRaces

Extremely popular custom races / npc types can be added but for most let them be handled in forks.
